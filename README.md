    The purpose of this project is to learn some of the basics in designing a web page. In the head section I linked the CSS style sheet and the CSS sheet and the CSS sheet for the nav bar. Also, I linked the Asul font to the CSS sheet. In the Navbar section I added my logo and navbar and set styled it with the CSS sheet I had linked previously. The next section contains the structure for the carousel. I took the code from level up coding. I tried to make it play automatically but was unable to after reading several articles from multiple sources and trying various code for the structure of the carousel. The next section I put in an image of me using the image tag followed by a list of my hobbies. After the hobbies section I put in a photo gallery and coded the format of the pictures to shift depending on the size of the screen. In the section titled “Lit” I took text and formatted it to look nice on the page. After the “Lit” section I put in an iframe and linked a video and out in some functions like the accelerometer. The last section is for the contact form, in this section is set up an interactive form with various menus and radial buttons that offer any user the ability to get in contact with the person who designed the site.
The color scheme I chose for my site was green (code #57AB5E) with blue text (code #0808ad) I chose these colors because I personally really like green and I thought that a richer green with a dark enough blue would provide a nice looking page while making the letters on the page look good while being easily legible. For the navbar I wanted a darker color. After seeing examples of several nav bar colors, I decided to go for a dark gray nav bar(rgb (68,63,68)) with white text(rgb(245,245,245)).
